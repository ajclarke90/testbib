abstract = {We analyse a high-resolution, fully cosmological, hydrodynamical disc galaxy simulation, to study the source of the double-exponential light profiles seen in many stellar discs, and the effects of stellar radial migration upon the spatiotemporal evolution of both the disc age and metallicity distributions. We find a `break' in the pure exponential stellar surface brightness profile, and trace its origin to a sharp decrease in the star formation per unit surface area, itself produced by a decrease in the gas volume density due to a warping of the gas disc. Star formation in the disc continues well beyond the break. We find that the break is more pronounced in bluer wavebands. By contrast, we find little or no break in the mass density profile. This is, in part, due to the net radial migration of stars towards the external parts of the disc. Beyond the break radius, we find that \~{}60 per cent of the resident stars migrated from the inner disc, while \~{}25 per cent formed in situ. Our simulated galaxy also has a minimum in the age profile at the break radius but, in disagreement with some previous studies, migration is not the main mechanism producing this shape. In our simulation, the disc metallicity gradient flattens with time, consistent with an `inside-out' formation scenario. We do not find any difference in the intensity or the position of the break with inclination, suggesting that perhaps the differences found in empirical studies are driven by dust extinction.},

abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than \$r\^{}\{-2\}\$ near the center and steeper than \$r\^{}\{-2\}\$ near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

abstract = {We examine the chemical properties of five cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of an M33-like disc galaxy which have been shown previously to be consistent with the morphological characteristics and bulk scaling relations expected of late-type spirals. These simulations are part of the Making Galaxies in a Cosmological Context Project, in which stellar feedback is tuned to match the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. Each realization employed identical initial conditions and assembly histories, but differed from one another in their underlying baryonic physics prescriptions, including (a) the efficiency with which each supernova energy couples to the surrounding interstellar medium, (b) the impact of feedback associated with massive star radiation pressure, (c) the role of the minimum shut-off time for radiative cooling of Type II supernovae remnants, (d) the treatment of metal diffusion and (e) varying the initial mass function. Our analysis focusses on the resulting stellar metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) in each simulated (analogous) 'solar neighbourhood' (2-3 disc scalelengths from the galactic centre) and central 'bulge' region. We compare and contrast the simulated MDFs' skewness, kurtosis and dispersion (inter-quartile, inter-decile, inter-centile and inter-tenth-percentile regions) with that of the empirical solar neighbourhood MDF and Local Group dwarf galxies. We find that the MDFs of the simulated discs are more negatively skewed, with higher kurtosis, than those observed locally in the Milky Way and Local Group dwarfs. We can trace this difference to the simulations' very tight and correlated age-metallicity relations (compared with that of the Milky Way's solar neighbourhood), suggesting that these relations within 'dwarf' discs might be steeper than in L⋆ discs (consistent with the simulations' star formation histories and extant empirical data), and/or the degree of stellar orbital redistribution and migration inferred locally has not been captured in their entirety, at the resolution of our simulations. The important role of metal diffusion in ameliorating the overproduction of extremely metal-poor stars is highlighted.},

@article{Minchev2011,
abstract = {We have recently identified a new radial migration mechanism resulting from the overlap of spiral and bar resonances in galactic disks. Here we confirm the efficiency of this mechanism in fully self-consistent, Tree-SPH simulations, as well as high-resolution pure N-body simulations. In all barred cases we clearly identify the effect of spiral-bar resonance overlap by measuring a bimodality in the changes of angular momentum in the disk, $\Delta$L, whose maxima are near the bar's corotation and outer Lindblad resonance. This contrasts with the smooth distribution of $\Delta$L for a simulation with no stable bar present, where strong radial migration is induced by multiple spirals. The presence of a disk gaseous component appears to increase the rate of angular momentum exchange by about 20\%. The efficiency of this mechanism is such that galactic stellar disks can extend to over 10 scale-lengths within 1-3 Gyr in both Milky Way size and low-mass galaxies (circular velocity \~{}100 km s-1). We also show that metallicity gradients can flatten in less than 1 Gyr rendering mixing in barred galaxies an order of magnitude more efficient than previously thought.},

Two classification indices are determined, one measuring the strength of the H$\beta$ line, the other the Balmer discontinuity. Both indices are practically uninfluenced by interstellar reddening. Results of observations with the 82-inch reflector of the McDonald Observatory in February and March, 1953, are compared with spectral classification by W. W. MORGAN, with colour indices (B-V) on HAROLD JOHNSON's system, and with absolute magnitudes from trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic determinations. The photometric probable error (one observation) of a (B-V) value predicted from the two classification indices is ± 0 m.006, corresponding to a probable error ±0·02 of a spectral class. The photometric probable error (one observation) of a predicted value of the visual of the visual absolute magnitude M$\nu$ is ± 0 m.18. The comparison with the data mentioned above indicates that the influence of cosmical scatter on the predicted (B-V) and M$\nu$ values is small, or negligible.

@article{Ebeling2013,
abstract = {Ram-pressure stripping by the gaseous intra-cluster medium has been proposed as the dominant physical mechanism driving the rapid evolution of galaxies in dense environments. Detailed studies of this process have, however, largely been limited to relatively modest examples affecting only the outermost gas layers of galaxies in nearby and/or low-mass galaxy clusters. We here present results from our search for extreme cases of gas-galaxy interactions in much more massive, X-ray selected clusters at \$z>0.3\$. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) snapshots in the F606W and F814W passbands, we have discovered dramatic evidence of ram-pressure stripping in which copious amounts of gas are first shock compressed and then removed from galaxies falling into the cluster. Vigorous starbursts triggered by this process across the galaxy-gas interface and in the debris trail cause these galaxies to temporarily become some of the brightest cluster members in the F606W passband, capable of outshining even the Brightest Cluster Galaxy. Based on the spatial distribution and orientation of systems viewed nearly edge-on in our survey, we speculate that infall at large impact parameter gives rise to particularly long-lasting stripping events. Our sample of six spectacular examples identified in clusters from the Massive Cluster Survey (MACS), all featuring \$M\_\{\backslash rm F606W\}<-\$21 mag, doubles the number of such systems presently known at \$z>0.2\$ and facilitates detailed quantitative studies of the most violent galaxy evolution in clusters.},

@article{Haywood2008,
abstract = {The analysis of the kinematics of solar neighbourhood stars shows that the low- and high-metallicity tails of the thin disc are populated by objects which orbital properties suggest an origin in the outer and inner Galactic disc, respectively. Signatures of radial migration are identified in various recent samples, and are shown to be responsible for the high-metallicity dispersion in the age-metallicity distribution. Most importantly, it is shown that the population of low-metallicity wanderers of the thin disc (-0.7 < [Fe/H] < -0.3 dex) is also responsible for the apparent hiatus in metallicity with the thick disc (which terminal metallicity is about -0.2 dex). It implies that the thin disc at the solar circle has started to form stars at about this same metallicity. This is also consistent with the fact that `transition' objects, which have $\alpha$-element abundance intermediate between that of the thick and thin discs, are found in the range [-0.4, -0.2] dex. Once the metal-poor thin disc stars are recognized for what they are - wanderers from the outer thin disc - the parenthood between the two discs can be identified on stars genuinely formed at the solar circle through an evolutionary sequence in [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H]. Another consequence is that stars that can be considered as truly resulting of the chemical evolution at the solar circle have a metallicity restricted to about [-0.2, +0.2] dex, confirming an old idea that most chemical evolution in the Milky Way have preceded the thin disc formation.},

Our evolution code, a version of TreeSPH (Hernquist \&amp; Katz 1989) generalized to handle comoving coordinates and periodic boundary conditions, combines smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with the hierarchical tree method for computing gravitational forces. The Lagrangian hydrodynamics approach and individual time steps for gas particles give the algorithm a large dynamic range, which is essential for studies of galaxy formation in a cosmological context. The code incorporates radiative cooling for an optically thin, primordial composition gas in ionization equilibrium with a user-specified ultraviolet background. We adopt a phenomenological prescription for star formation that gradually turns cold, dense, Jeans-unstable gas into collisionless stars, returning supernova feedback energy to the surrounding medium. In CDM simulations, some of the baryons that fall into dark matter potential wells dissipate their acquired thermal energy and condense into clumps with roughly galactic masses. The resulting galaxy population is insensitive to assumptions about star formation; we obtain similar baryonic mass functions and galaxy correlation functions from simulations with star formation and from simulations without star formation in which we identify galaxies directly from the cold, dense gas.},

The halo angular momentum required to avoid strong braking is unrealistically large, even when rotation is confined to the inner halo only.

This stellar disk sample is used to investigate the age-metallicity diagram in the solar neighbourhood. Such diagrams are often used to derive a so called age-metallicity relation. Because of the size of our sample, we are able to quantify the impact on such diagrams, and derived relations, due to different selection effects. Some of these effects are of a more subtle sort, giving rise to erroneous conclusions. In particular we show that [1] the age-metallicity diagram is well populated at all ages and especially that old, metal-rich stars do exist, [2] the scatter in metallicity at any given age is larger than the observational errors, [3] the exclusion of cooler dwarf stars from an age-metallicity sample preferentially excludes old, metal-rich stars, depleting the upper right-hand corner of the age-metallicity diagram, [4] the distance dependence found in the Edvardsson et al. sample by Garnett \&amp; Kobulnicky is an expected artifact due to the construction of the original sample. We conclude that, although some of it can be attributed to stellar migration in the galactic disk, a large part of the observed scatter is intrinsic to the formation processes of stars.

abstract = {We run N-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of a Milky Way-sized galaxy. The code takes into account hydrodynamics, self-gravity, star formation, supernova and stellar wind feedback, radiative cooling and metal enrichment. The simulated galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy consisting of a stellar and gas disc, enveloped in a static dark matter halo. Similar to what is found in our pure N-body simulation of a non-barred galaxy in Grand et al., we find that the spiral arms are transient features whose pattern speeds decrease with radius, in such a way that the pattern speed is similar to the rotation of star particles. Compared to the non-barred case, we find that the spiral arm pattern speed is slightly faster than the rotation speed of star particles: the bar appears to boost the pattern speed ahead of the rotational velocity. We trace particle motion around the spiral arms at different radii, and demonstrate that there are star particles that are drawn towards and join the arm from behind (in front of) the arm and migrate towards the outer (inner) regions of the disc until the arm disappears as a result of their transient nature. We see this migration over the entire radial range analysed, which is a consequence of the spiral arm rotating at similar speeds to star particles at all radii, which is inconsistent with the prediction of classical density wave theory. The bar does not prevent this systematic radial migration, which is shown to largely preserve circular orbits. We also demonstrate that there is no significant offset of different star-forming tracers across the spiral arm, which is also inconsistent with the prediction of classical density wave theory.},

abstract = {We use a suite of numerical simulations to investigate the mechanisms and effects of radial migration of stars in disc galaxies such as the Milky Way (MW). An isolated, collisionless stellar disc with an MW-like scaleheight shows only the radial 'blurring' expected of epicyclic orbits. Reducing the disc thickness or adding gas to the disc substantially increases the level of radial migration, induced by interaction with transient spiral arms and/or a central bar. We also examine collisionless discs subjected to gravitational perturbations from a cosmologically motivated satellite accretion history. In the perturbed disc that best reproduces the observed properties of MW, 20 per cent of stars that end up in the solar annulus 7 kpc \&lt; R \&lt; 9 kpc started at R \&lt; 6 kpc, and 7 per cent started at R \&gt; 10 kpc. This level of migration would add considerable dispersion to the age-metallicity relation of solar neighbourhood stars. In the isolated disc models, the probability of migration traces the disc's radial mass profile, but in perturbed discs migration occurs preferentially at large radii, where the disc is more weakly bound. The orbital dynamics of migrating particles are also different in isolated and perturbed discs: satellite perturbations drive particles to lower angular momentum for a given change in radius. Thus, satellite perturbations appear to be a distinct mechanism for inducing radial migration, which can operate in concert with migration induced by bars and spiral structures. We investigate correlations between changes in radius and changes in orbital circularity or vertical energy, identifying signatures that might be used to test models and distinguish radial migration mechanisms in chemodynamical surveys of the MW disc.},

abstract = {Growth rates for gravitational instabilities in a thick disk of gas and stars are determined for a turbulent gas that dissipates on the local crossing time. The scale heights are derived from vertical equilibrium. The accuracy of the usual thickness correction, (1 + kH)-1, is better than 6\% in the growth rate when compared to exact integrations for the gravitational acceleration in the disk. Gas dissipation extends the instability to small scales, removing the minimum Jeans length. This makes infinitesimally thin disks unstable for all Toomre-Q values and reasonably thick disks stable at high Q primarily because of thickness effects. The conventional gas+star threshold, Q tot, increases from \~{}1 without dissipation to 2 or 3 when dissipation has a rate equal to the crossing rate over a perturbation scale. Observations of Q tot \~{} 2-3 and the presence of supersonic turbulence suggest that disks are unstable over a wide range of scales. Such instabilities drive spiral structure if there is shear and clumpy structure if shear is weak; they may dominate the generation of turbulence. Feedback regulation of Q tot is complex because the stellar component does not cool; the range of spiral strengths from multiple arm to flocculent galaxies suggests that feedback is weak. Gravitational instabilities may have a connection to star formation even when the star formation rate scales directly with the molecular mass because the instabilities return dispersed gas to molecular clouds and complete the cycle of cloud formation and destruction. The mass flow to dense clouds by instabilities can be 10 times larger than the star formation rate.},

abstract = {We perform fully self-consistent N-body simulations of a system of disk, halo, and satellite to investigate three different dynamical responses of a disk to an infalling satellite: tilting, warping, and thickening. Our model is characterized by two cosmologically significant improvements. First, the satellites start at a distance more than 3 times the radius of the optical disk, which ensures a realistic interaction among the satellite, the disk, and the halo in the course of the satellite infall. Second, we allow evolution of the structure and velocity ellipsoid of the disk due to internal heating. We study the commonly arising case of low-density satellites in contrast to that of compact satellites considered in previous work. We find that disks are mainly tilted rather than heated by infalling satellites. Satellites of 10\%, 20\%, and 30\% of the disk mass tilt the disk by angles of 2.dg9 +/- 0.dg3, 6.dg3 +/- 0.dg1, and 10.dg6 +/- 0.dg2. However, only 3.4\%, 6.9\%, and 11.1\% of the orbital angular momentum is transferred to the parent galaxy. The kinetic energy associated with vertical motion in the initial coordinate frame of the disk is respectively increased by (6 +/- 3)\%, (26 +/- 3)\%, and (51 +/- 5)\%, whereas the corresponding thermal energy associated with the vertical random motion in the tilted coordinate frame is only increased by (4 +/- 3)\%, (6 +/- 2)\%, and (10 +/- 2)\%, respectively. The satellites cause warps that are substantially damped over 30 disk rotations. Given our choice of initial conditions, satellites are mainly accreted to the parent halos. Satellites having up to 20\% of the disk mass produce no observable thickening, whereas a satellite with 30\% of the disk mass produces little observable thickening inside the half-mass radius but great damage beyond this radius. Hence, high cosmological accretion and thin disks can coexist if most infalling satellites have densities comparable to that of the parent galaxy.},

abstract = {We seek to understand the origin of radial migration in spiral galaxies by analyzing in detail the structure and evolution of an idealized, isolated galactic disk. To understand the redistribution of stars, we characterize the time-evolution of properties of spirals that spontaneously form in the disk. Our models unambiguously show that in such disks, single spirals are unlikely, but that a number of transient patterns may coexist in the disk. However, we also show that while spirals are transient in amplitude, at any given time the disk favors patterns of certain pattern speeds. Using several runs with different numerical parameters we show that the properties of spirals that occur spontaneously in the disk do not sensitively depend on resolution. The existence of multiple transient patterns has large implications for the orbits of stars in the disk, and we therefore examine the resonant scattering mechanisms that profoundly alter angular momenta of individual stars. We confirm that the corotation scattering mechanism described by Sellwood \& Binney (2002) is responsible for the largest angular momentum changes in our simulations.},

abstract = {Previously calculated models of the collapse of protogalaxies with rotational and axial symmetry are extended to galaxies characterized by both a spheroidal component and a disk component containing a substantial fraction of the total mass. The predicted disk-to-bulge ratio is found to depend mainly on the assumed rate of star formation and its time variation. It is shown that formation of the spheroidal component requires an early stage of rapid star formation, while formation of the disk requires a later stage of much slower star formation to allow the residual gas to settle into the disk before forming stars. The calculations suggest that the slow phase of star formation may involve relatively diffuse gas, the rapid phase may involve strongly clumped gas, and the degree of clumping may depend on the intensity of the turbulence or collisions within the gas. The models also predict stellar metallicity distributions and kinematic properties that are in qualitative agreement with those of the stellar populations in the Milky Way and other spirals, as well as a long time scale for the formation of the outer regions of the disk.},

abstract = {Models of the chemical evolution of our Galaxy are extended to include radial migration of stars and flow of gas through the disc. The models track the production of both iron and alpha elements. A model is chosen that provides an excellent fit to the metallicity distribution of stars in the Geneva-Copenhagen survey (GCS) of the solar neighbourhood, and a good fit to the local Hess diagram. The model provides a good fit to the distribution of GCS stars in the age-metallicity plane although this plane was not used in the fitting process. Although this model's star-formation rate is monotonic declining, its disc naturally splits into an alpha-enhanced thick disc and a normal thin disc. In particular the model's distribution of stars in the ([O/Fe],[Fe/H]) plane resembles that of Galactic stars in displaying a ridge line for each disc. The thin-disc's ridge line is entirely due to stellar migration and there is the characteristic variation of stellar angular momentum along it that has been noted by Haywood in survey data. Radial mixing of stellar populations with high sigma\_z from inner regions of the disc to the solar neighbourhood provides a natural explanation of why measurements yield a steeper increase of sigma\_z with age than predicted by theory. The metallicity gradient in the ISM is predicted to be steeper than in earlier models, but appears to be in good agreement with data for both our Galaxy and external galaxies. The models are inconsistent with a cutoff in the star-formation rate at low gas surface densities. The absolute magnitude of the disc is given as a function of time in several photometric bands, and radial colour profiles are plotted for representative times.},

Thus, within the last 4-5 billion years, galaxies in clusters underwent strong evolution that completely changed their character. By contrast, galaxies that are not associated with clusters show far less morphological evolution8. Here we propose that multiple highspeed encounters between galaxies-'galaxy harassment'- drives the morphological evolution in clusters. Our simulations show that these encounters are very different from mergers; they transform small disk galaxies into dwarf elliptical or dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Harassment will leave detectable debris arcs and could provide fuel for quasars in sub-luminous host galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive series of simulations to study the secular evolution of disk galaxies expected in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. Our simulations are organized in a hierarchy of increasing complexity, ranging from rigid-halo collisionless simulations to fully live simulations with gas and star formation. Our goal is to examine which structural properties of disk galaxies may result from secular evolution rather than from hierarchical assembly. In the vertical direction, we find that various mechanisms lead to heating, the strongest of which is the buckling instability of a bar, which leads to peanut-shaped bulges; these can be recognized face-on even in the presence of gas. We find that bars are robust structures that survive buckling and require a large (\~{}20\% of the total mass of the disk) central mass concentration to be destroyed. This can occur in dissipative simulations, where bars induce strong gas inflows, but requires that radiative cooling overcome heating. We show how angular momentum redistribution leads to increasing central densities and disk scale lengths and to profile breaks at large radii. The breaks in these simulations are in excellent agreement with observations, even when the evolution is collisionless. Disk scale lengths increase even when the total disk angular momentum is conserved; thus, mapping halo angular momenta to scale lengths is nontrivial. A decomposition of the resulting profile into a bulge+disk gives structural parameters in reasonable agreement with observations although kinematics betrays their bar nature. These findings have important implications for galaxy formation models, which have so far ignored or introduced in a very simplified way the effects of nonaxisymmetric instabilities on the morphological evolution of disk galaxies.},

The velocity dispersion profile of the Virgo cluster is quite similar to that of the Coma, and a tendency of the observed velocity dispersion decreasing towards the cluster center is found. There is a strong morphological segregation in both space and velocity for the cluster members, early-type galaxies being more concentrated towards the cluster center and showing a smaller velocity dispersion than late types ($\sigma$ = 615 versus 827 km/s). It is indicated from discussions on the virial mass and the mass segregation that the period of dynamic evolution when the Virgo cluster has been undergone is relatively quite short, almost no effect of mass segregation is shown, and it should be a young irregular cluster of galaxies.},

Motivated by this fact, we study the motion of the Sun in the Milky Way during the last 4.6 Gyr in order to find its birth radius. We carried out orbit integrations backward in time using an analytical model of the Galaxy which includes the contribution of spiral arms and a central bar. We took into account the uncertainty in the parameters of the Milky Way potential as well as the uncertainty in the present day position and velocity of the Sun. We find that in general the Sun has not migrated from its birth place to its current position in the Galaxy (R\_$\backslash$odot). However, significant radial migration of the Sun is possible when: 1) The 2:1 Outer Lindblad resonance of the bar is separated from the corrotation resonance of spiral arms by a distance \~{}1 kpc. 2) When these two resonances are at the same Galactocentric position and further than the solar radius. In both cases the migration of the Sun is from outer regions of the Galactic disk to R\_$\backslash$odot, placing the Sun's birth radius at around 11 kpc. We find that in general it is unlikely that the Sun has migrated significantly from the inner regions of the Galactic disk to R\_$\backslash$odot.},

The Lagrangian character of SPH allows it to automatically adjust its resolution to the clumping of matter, a property that makes the scheme ideal for many applications in astrophysics, where often a large dynamic range in density is encountered. We discuss the derivation of the basic SPH equations in their modern formulation, and give an overview about extensions of SPH developed to treat physics such as radiative transfer, thermal conduction, relativistic dynamics or magnetic fields. We also briefly describe some of the most important applications areas of SPH in astrophysical research.

abstract = {Measurements of H alpha , H I, and CO distributions in 61 normal spiral galaxies are combined with published far-infrared and CO observations of 36 infrared-selected starburst galaxies, in order to study the form of the global star formation law over the full range of gas densities and star formation rates (SFRs) observed in galaxies. The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful "recipes" for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

We use both controlled simulations in which only a single spiral mode is excited, as well as slightly more realistic cases with multiple spiral patterns and a bar. We find that rms angular momentum changes are reduced by vertical motion, but rather gradually, and the maximum changes are almost as large for thick disc stars as for those in a thin disc. We find that particles in simulations in which a bar forms suffer slightly larger angular momentum changes than in comparable cases with no bar, but the cumulative effect of multiple spiral events still dominates. We have determined that vertical action, and not vertical energy, is conserved on average during radial migration.},

Attention is given to evidence which contradicts the interpretation that these gradients in population result from the production of S0 galaxies when spirals are swept of disk gas by an IGM. In addition, as an alternative to the hypothesis of spiral sweeping, it is suggested that the local density/morphological-type relation reflects the long time scale associated with the formation of the disk component of galaxies.

@article{Weinberg1998,
abstract = {This paper describes a method, based on linear perturbation theory, to determine the dynamical interaction between extended halo and spheroid components and an environmental disturbance. One finds that resonant interaction between a galaxy and passing interlopers or satellite companions can carry the disturbance inward, deep inside the halo, where it can perturb the disc. Applied to the Milky Way for example, the LMC and SMC appear to be sufficient to cause the observed Galactic warp and possibly seed other asymmetries. This is a multi-scale interaction in which the halo wake has a feature at roughly half the satellite orbital radius owing to a 2:1 orbital resonance. The rotating disturbance then excites an m=1 vertical disc mode which has the classic integral-sign morphology. A polar satellite orbit produces the largest warp and therefore the inferred LMC orbit is nearly optimal for maximum warp production. Both the magnitude and morphology of the response depend on the details of the disc and halo models. Most critically, a change in the halo profile will shift the resonant frequencies and response location and consequently alter the coupling to the bending disc. Increasing the halo support relative to the disc, a sub-maximal disc model, decreases the warp amplitude. Finally, the results and prognosis for N-body simulations are discussed. Discreteness noise in the halo, similar to that arising from a population of 10\^{}6-Msolar black holes, can produce observable warping.},

abstract = {We study the angular momentum profiles of a statistical sample of halos drawn from a high-resolution N-body simulation of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the cumulative mass distribution of specific angular momentum j in a halo of mass Mv is well fitted by a universal function, M(\&lt;j)=Mv$\mu$j/(j0+j). This profile is defined by one shape parameter ($\mu$ or j0) in addition to the global spin parameter $\lambda$. It follows a power law M(\&lt;j)\~{}j over most of the mass and flattens at large j, with the flattening more pronounced for small values of $\mu$ (or large j0 at a fixed $\lambda$). Compared to a uniform sphere in solid-body rotation, most halos have a higher fraction of their mass in the low- and high-j tails of the distribution. High-$\lambda$ halos tend to have high $\mu$ values, corresponding to a narrower, more uniform j distribution. The spatial distribution of angular momentum in halos tends to be cylindrical and is well-aligned within each halo for \~{}80\% of the halos. The more misaligned halos tend to have low $\mu$ values. When averaged over spherical shells encompassing mass M, the halo j profiles are fitted by j(M)\~{}Ms with s=1.3+/-0.3. We investigate two ideas for the origin of this profile. The first is based on a revised version of linear tidal-torque theory combined with extended Press-Schechter mass accretion, and the second focuses on j transport in minor mergers. Finally, we briefly explore implications of the M(\&lt;j) profile on the formation of galactic disks assuming that j is conserved during an adiabatic baryonic infall. The implied gas density profile deviates from an exponential disk, with a higher density at small radii and a tail extending to large radii. The steep central density profiles may imply disk scale lengths that are smaller than observed. This is reminiscent of the ``angular momentum problem'' seen in hydrodynamic simulations, even though we have assumed perfect j conservation. A possible solution is to associate the central excesses with bulge components and the outer regions with extended gaseous disks.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that the chaotic nature of N-body systems can lead to macroscopic variations in the evolution of collisionless simulations containing rotationally supported discs. The unavoidable stochasticity that afflicts all simulations generally causes mild differences between the evolution of similar models but, in order to illustrate that this is not always true, we present a case that shows an extreme bimodal divergence. The divergent behaviour occurs in two different types of code, and is independent of all numerical parameters. We identify and give explicit illustrations of several sources of stochasticity, and also show that macroscopic variations in the evolution can originate from differences at the round-off error level. We obtain somewhat more consistent results from simulations in which the halo is set-up with great care compared with those started from more approximate equilibria, but we have been unable to eliminate diverging behaviour entirely because the main sources of stochasticity are intrinsic to the disc. We show that the divergence is only temporary and that halo friction is merely delayed, for a substantial time in some cases. We argue that the delays are unlikely to arise in real galaxies, and that our results do not affect dynamical friction constraints on halo density. Stochastic variations in the evolution are inevitable in all simulations of disc-halo systems, irrespective of how they were created, although their effect is generally far less extreme than we find here. The possibility of divergent behaviour complicates comparison of results from different workers.},

abstract = {We present and discuss new determinations of metallicity, rotation, age, kinematics, and Galactic orbits for a complete, magnitude-limited, and kinematically unbiased sample of 16,682 nearby F and G dwarf stars. Our 63,000 new, accurate radial-velocity observations for nearly 13,500 stars allow identification of most of the binary stars in the sample and, together with published data complete the kinematic information for 14,139 stars. A major effort has been devoted to the determination of new isochrone ages for all stars for which this is possible. Particular attention has been given to a realistic treatment of statistical biases and error estimates, as standard techniques tend to underestimate these effects and introduce spurious features in the age distributions. We demonstrate, however, how strong observational and theoretical biases cause the distribution of the observed ages to be very different from that of the true age distribution of the sample. Our first results confirm the lack of metal-poor G dwarfs relative to closed-box model predictions (the ``G dwarf problem''), the existence of radial metallicity gradients in the disk, the small change in mean metallicity of the thin disk since its formation and the substantial scatter in metallicity at all ages, and the continuing kinematic heating of the thin disk with an efficiency consistent with that expected for a combination of spiral arms and giant molecular clouds. Distinct features in the distribution of the V component of the space motion are extended in age and metallicity, corresponding to the effects of stochastic spiral waves rather than classical moving groups, and may complicate the identification of thick-disk stars from kinematic criteria.

Moreover, warps generated in this way have no winding problem and are more pronounced in the extended $\backslash$h1 disk. As emphasized by Binney and his co-workers, angular momentum misalignments, which are expected in hierarchical models of galaxy formation, can account for the high fraction of warped galaxies.

abstract = {The goal of this work is to show how large cosmological N-body simulations are computed, how structures within such simulations can be identified with observed galaxies, and how the weak gravitational lensing effect of large scale structure introduces changes in the observed brightness of high redshift sources. We describe PKDGRAV, a fully parallel N-body code that can both spatially adapt to large ranges in particle densities, and temporally adapt to large ranges in dynamical timescales. Care has been taken to insure that the code runs efficiently on a variety of parallel architectures. This has led us to using a non-standard data structure for efficiently calculating the gravitational forces, a variant on the k-D tree, and a new method for treating periodic boundary conditions. A major problem with the interpretation of cosmological N-body simulations has always been identifying the positions and velocities of the ``galaxies'' in simulations. Observational constraints almost always concern the position and velocities of galaxies, not of the dark matter background. We present our grouping algorithm, SKID, which can identify galaxy halos independent of the environment in which the halo is found, a property that is very important given the large dynamic range in background densities present in cosmological simulations. PKDGRAV has been used to perform many very high resolution cosmological N-body simulations. We give an overview of some of the scientific program that has been enabled by this code. We present the magnification distributions due to weak lensing through all the intervening large scale structure from an observer to a source at z = 1. We show that the distribution is a highly skewed one with a shifted mode implying a slight demagnification bias and an extended tail toward high magnification. We investigate the implications of these results on the observations of high redshift type-Ia supernovae and show how these can be used to provide a new cosmological test.},

abstract = {The separation of the Milky Way disk into a thin and thick component is supported by differences in the spatial, kinematic and metallicity distributions of their stars. These differences have led to the view that the thick disk formed early via a cataclysmic event and constitutes fossil evidence of the hierarchical growth of the Milky Way. We show here, using N-body simulations, how a double-exponential vertical structure, with stellar populations displaying similar dichotomies can arise purely through internal evolution. In this picture, stars migrate radially, while retaining nearly circular orbits, as described by Sellwood \& Binney (2002). As stars move outwards they populate a thickened component. Such stars found at the present time in the solar neighborhood formed early in the disk's history at smaller radii where stars are more metal-poor and alpha-enhanced, leading to the properties observed for thick disk stars. Classifying stars as members of the thin or thick disk by either velocity or metallicity leads to an apparent separation in the other property as observed. This scenario is supported by the SDSS observation that stars in the transition region do not show any correlation between rotational velocity and metallicity. The good qualitative agreement between our simulation and observations in the Milky Way hint that the thick disk may be a ubiquitous galaxy feature generated by stellar migration. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that some fraction of the thick disk is a fossil of a past more violent history, nor can this scenario explain thick disks in all galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of a disc galaxy forming in a high-resolution fully cosmological simulation to investigate the nature of the outer regions of discs and their relevance for the disc formation process. Specifically, we focus on the phenomenon of misaligned disc components and find that the outer disc warp is a consequence of the misalignment between the inner disc and the surrounding hot gaseous halo. As the infalling cold gas sinks towards the centre of the galaxy, it is strongly torqued by the hot gas halo. By the time the fresh gas reaches the central disc-forming region, its angular momentum is completely aligned with the spin of the hot gas halo. If the spin of the hot gas halo, in turn, is not aligned with that of the inner disc, a misaligned outer disc forms, comprised of newly accreted material. The inner and outer components are misaligned with each other because they respond differently to infalling substructure and accretion. The warped disc feeds the main gas disc due to viscous angular momentum losses, but small amounts of star formation in the warp itself form a low-metallicity thick disc. We show that observations of resolved stellar populations in warped galaxies in the local Universe could provide evidence for the presence of these processes and therefore indirectly reveal ongoing gas accretion and the existence of hot gas haloes.},

About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will observe a 20,000 deg2 region about 1000 times during the anticipated 10 years of operations (distributed over six bands, ugrizy). Each 30-second long visit will deliver 5$\sigma$ depth for point sources of r\~{}24.5 on average. The co-added map will be about 3 magnitudes deeper, and will include 10 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars. We discuss various measurements that will be automatically performed for these 20 billion sources, and how they can be used for classification and determination of source physical and other properties. We provide a few classification examples based on SDSS data, such as color classification of stars, color-spatial proximity search for wide-angle binary stars, orbital-color classification of asteroid families, and the recognition of main Galaxy components based on the distribution of stars in the position-metallicity-kinematics space. Guided by these examples, we anticipate that two grand classification challenges for LSST will be 1) rapid and robust classification of sources detected in difference images, and 2) simultaneous treatment of diverse astrometric and photometric time series measurements for an unprecedentedly large number of objects.},

We report results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art, multi-stepping, parallel N-body codes: PKDGRAV and GADGET. We find that convergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of the gravitational softening, timestep, force accuracy, initial redshift, and particle number. For softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effects are negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii where the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the timestep is much shorter than the local orbital timescale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristic acceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enough particles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation timescale is longer than the age of the universe. The most stringent requirement for convergence is typically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxation criterion, which implies that in order to estimate accurate circular velocities at radii where the density contrast may reach \$\backslash sim 10\^{}6\$, the region must enclose of order 3000 particles (or more than a few times \$10\^{}6\$ within the virial radius). Applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized \$\backslash Lambda\$CDM halo, we find that the spherically-averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slope shallower than -1.2 at the innermost resolved point, \$r \backslash sim 0.005 r\_\{200\}\$, with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the inner regions.},

abstract = {We present the first dynamical analysis of a galaxy cluster to include a large fraction of dwarf galaxies. Our sample of 108 Fornax Cluster members measured with the UK Schmidt Telescope FLAIR-II spectrograph contains 55 dwarf galaxies (15.5\&gt;bJ\&gt;18.0 or -16\&gt;MB\&gt;-13.5). H$\alpha$ emission shows that 36\%+/-8\% of the dwarfs are star forming, twice the fraction implied by morphological classifications. The total sample has a mean velocity of 1493+/-36 km s-1 and a velocity dispersion of 374+/-26 km s-1. The dwarf galaxies form a distinct population: their velocity dispersion (429+/-41 km s-1) is larger than that of the giants (308+/-30 km s-1) at the 98\% confidence level. This suggests that the dwarf population is dominated by infalling objects whereas the giants are virialized. The Fornax system has two components, the main Fornax Cluster centered on NGC 1399 with cz=1478 km s-1 and $\sigma$cz=370 km s-1 and a subcluster centered 3° to the southwest including NGC 1316 with cz=1583 km s-1 and $\sigma$cz=377 km s-1. This partition is preferred over a single cluster at the 99\% confidence level. The subcluster, a site of intense star formation, is bound to Fornax and probably infalling toward the cluster core for the first time. We discuss the implications of this substructure for distance estimates of the Fornax Cluster. We determine the cluster mass profile using the method of Diaferio, which does not assume a virialized sample. The mass within a projected radius of 1.4 Mpc is (7+/-2)×1013 Msolar, and the mass-to-light ratio is 300+/-100 Msolar/Lsolar. The mass is consistent with values derived from the projected mass virial estimator and X-ray measurements at smaller radii.},

We find that the analytic expectation of Gunn \&amp; Gott, relating the gravitational restoring force provided by the disc to the ram pressure force, provides a good approximation to the radius at which gas will be stripped from a galaxy. However, at small radii it is also important to consider the potential provided by the bulge component. A spiral galaxy passing through the core of a rich cluster, such as Coma, will have its gaseous disc truncated to \~{}4kpc, thus losing \~{}80per cent of its diffuse gas mass. The time-scale for this to occur is a fraction of a crossing time \~{}10\^{}7yr. Galaxies orbiting within poorer clusters, or inclined to the direction of motion through the intracluster medium, will lose significantly less gas. We conclude that ram pressure alone is insufficient to account for the rapid and widespread truncation of star formation observed in cluster galaxies, or the morphological transformation of Sabs to S0s that is necessary to explain the Butcher-Oemler effect.},

abstract = {The individual star formation histories of bulges and discs of lenticular (S0) galaxies can provide information on the processes involved in the quenching of their star formation and subsequent transformation from spirals. In order to study this transformation in dense environments, we have decomposed long-slit spectroscopic observations of a sample of 21 S0s from the Virgo Cluster to produce one-dimensional spectra representing purely the bulge and disc light for each galaxy. Analysis of the Lick indices within these spectra reveals that the bulges contain consistently younger and more metal-rich stellar populations than their surrounding discs, implying that the final episode of star formation within S0s occurs in their central regions. Analysis of the \$\backslash alpha\$-element abundances in these components further presents a picture in which the final episode of star formation in the bulge is fueled using gas that has previously been chemically enriched in the disc, indicating the sequence of events in the transformation of these galaxies. Systems in which star formation in the disk was spread over a longer period contain bulges in which the final episode of star formation occurred more recently, as one might expect for an approximately coeval population in which the transformation from spiral to S0 occurred at different times. With data of this quality and the new analysis method deployed here, we can begin to describe this process in a quantitative manner for the first time.},

abstract = {We use cosmological, chemodynamical, SPH simulations of Milky Way-analog galaxies to find the expected present-day distributions of both metal-free stars that formed from primordial gas and the oldest star populations. We find that metal-free stars continue to form until z\~{}4 in halos that are chemically isolated and located far away from the biggest progenitor of the final system. As a result, if the Population III initial mass function allows stars with low enough mass to survive until z=0 (\&lt;0.8 Msolar), they would be distributed throughout the Galactic halo. On the other hand, the oldest stars form in halos that collapsed close to the highest density peak of the final system, and at z=0 they are located preferentially in the central region of the Galaxy, i.e., in the bulge. According to our models, these trends are not sensitive to the merger histories of the disk galaxies or the implementation of supernova feedback. Furthermore, these full hydrodynamics results are consistent with our N-body results in Paper I and lend further weight to the conclusion that surveys of low-metallicity stars in the Galactic halo can be used to directly constrain the properties of primordial stars. In particular, they suggest that the current lack of detections of metal-free stars implies that their lifetimes were shorter than a Hubble time, placing constraints on the metal-free initial mass function.},

abstract = {Aims: This work aims to provide a new mass estimate for the Fornax cluster and the Fornax-Eridanus complex, avoiding methods like the virial or fits of the X-ray emission profile, which assume that the system is in equilibrium. This is probably not the case for Fornax, because it is still in process of formation.  Methods: Our mass estimate is based on determination of the zero-velocity surface, which, in the context of the spherical infall model, permits an evaluation of the total mass inside such a surface. The zero-velocity surface radius R0 was estimated either by a running median procedure or by fitting the data to the velocity field expected from the spherical model, including effects of the cosmological constant. The velocity field in a region within 20 Mpc of the Fornax center was mapped using a list of 109 galaxies whose distances have an average accuracy of 0.31 mag in their distance modulus.  Results: Our analysis indicates that the mass of the Fornax cluster itself is [0.40-3.32] × 1014 M⊙ inside a radius of [2.62-5.18] Mpc while the mass inside [3.88-5.60] Mpc, corresponding to the Fornax-Eridanus complex, is [1.30-3.93] × 1014 M⊙.

@article{Haywood2013,
abstract = {We analyze a sample of solar neighborhood stars that have high-quality abundance determinations and show that there are two distinct regimes of [$\alpha$/Fe] versus age, which we identify as the epochs of the thick and thin disk formation. A tight correlation between metallicity and [$\alpha$/Fe] versus age is clearly identifiable for thick disk stars, implying that this population formed from a well mixed interstellar medium, probably initially in starburst and then more quiescently, over a time scale of 4-5 Gyr. Thick disk stars have vertical velocity dispersions which correlate with age, with the youngest objects of this population having small scale heights similar to those of thin disk stars. A natural consequence of these two results is that a vertical metallicity gradient is expected in this population. We suggest that the youngest thick disk set the initial conditions from which the inner thin disk started to form about 8 Gyr ago, at [Fe/H] in the range of (-0.1, +0.1) dex and [$\alpha$/Fe] \~{} 0.1 dex. This also provides an explanation for the apparent coincidence between the existence of a step in metallicity at 7-10 kpc in the thin disk and the confinement of the thick disk within R < 10 kpc. We suggest that the outer thin disk developed outside the influence of the thick disk, giving rise to a separate structure, but also that the high alpha-enrichment of those regions may originate from a primordial pollution of the outer regions by the gas expelled from the forming thick disk. Metal-poor thin disk stars ([Fe/H] < -0.4 dex) in the solar vicinity, whose properties are best explained by them originating in the outer disk, are shown to be as old as the youngest thick disk (9-10 Gyr). This implies that the outer thin disk started to form while the thick disk was still forming stars in the inner parts of the Galaxy. Hence, while the overall inner (thick+thin) disk is comprised of two structures with different scale lengths and whose combination may give the impression of an inside-out formation process, the thin disk itself probably formed its first stars in its outskirts. Moreover, we point out that, given the tight age-metallicity and age-[$\alpha$/Fe] relations that exist in the thick disk, an inside-out process would give rise to a radial gradient in metallicity and $\alpha$-elements in this population, which is not observed. Finally, we argue that our results leave little room for radial migration (in the sense of churning) either to have contaminated the solar vicinity, or, on a larger scale, to have redistributed stars in significant proportion across the solar annulus.},

abstract = {Using the most recent proper-motion determination of the old, solar-metallicity, Galactic open cluster M67 in orbital computations in a non-axisymmetric model of the Milky Way, including a bar and three-dimensional spiral arms, we explore the possibility that the Sun once belonged to this cluster. We have performed Monte Carlo numerical simulations to generate the present-day orbital conditions of the Sun and M67, and all the parameters in the Galactic model. We compute 3.5 × 105 pairs of orbits Sun-M67 looking for close encounters in the past with a minimum distance approach within the tidal radius of M67. In these encounters we find that the relative velocity between the Sun and M67 is larger than 20 km s-1. If the Sun had been ejected from M67 with this high velocity by means of a three-body encounter, this interaction would have either destroyed an initial circumstellar disk around the Sun or dispersed its already formed planets. We also find a very low probability, much lower than 10-7, that the Sun was ejected from M67 by an encounter of this cluster with a giant molecular cloud. This study also excludes the possibility that the Sun and M67 were born in the same molecular cloud. Our dynamical results convincingly demonstrate that M67 could not have been the birth cluster of our solar system.  This work relies partly on observations of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT).

The interaction of the dark matter halo with the disk and resonances between the orbit of the Clouds and the disk account for the large amplitudes observed for the vertical m=0, 1, and 2 harmonics.

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of two fields located 26 kpc (˜5 radial scalelengths) from the centre of M31 along the south-west semimajor axis of the disc. One field samples the major axis populations - the Outer Disc field - while the other is offset by ˜18 arcmin and samples the warp in the stellar disc - the warp field. The colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) based on Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging reach old main-sequence turn-offs (˜12.5 Gyr). We apply the CMD-fitting technique to the warp field to reconstruct the star formation history (SFH). We find that after undergoing roughly constant star formation until about 4.5 Gyr ago, there was a rapid decline in activity and then a ˜1.5 Gyr lull, followed by a strong burst lasting 1.5 Gyr and responsible for 25 per cent of the total stellar mass in this field. This burst appears to be accompanied by a decline in global metallicity which could be a signature of the inflow of metal-poor gas. The onset of the burst (˜3 Gyr ago) corresponds to the last close passage of M31 and M33 as predicted by detailed N-body modelling, and may have been triggered by this event. We reprocess the deep M33 outer disc field data of Barker et al. in order to compare consistently derived SFHs. This reveals a similar duration burst that is exactly coeval with that seen in the M31 warp field, lending further support to the interaction hypothesis. We reliably trace star formation as far back as 12-13 Gyr ago in the outer disc of M31, while the onset of star formation occurred about 2 Gyr later in M33, with median stellar ages of 7.5 and 4.5 Gyr, respectively. The complex SFHs derived, as well as the smoothly varying age-metallicity relations, suggest that the stellar populations observed in the far outer discs of both galaxies have largely formed in situ rather than migrated from smaller galactocentric radii. The strong differential reddening affecting the CMD of the Outer Disc field prevents derivation of the SFH using the same method. Instead, we quantify this reddening and find that the fine-scale distribution of dust precisely follows that of the H I gas. This indicates that the outer H I disc of M31 contains a substantial amount of dust and therefore suggests significant metal enrichment in these parts, consistent with inferences from our CMD analysis. a Projected radial distance. b Deprojected radial distances are calculated assuming (m-M)0= 24.47 (Holland 1998) and an inclined disc with PA = 38°1 (Ferguson et al. 2002) and i= 77°5 (Ma, Peng \& Gu 1997). c Values from Schlegel, Finkbeiner \& Davis (1998). d Individual and total exposure times in the F606W band. e Individual and total exposure times in the F814W band.},

@article{Minchev2010,
abstract = {While it has long been known that a large number of short-lived transient spirals can cause stellar migration, here we report that another mechanism is also effective at mixing disks of barred galaxies. The resonance overlap of the bar and spiral structure induces a nonlinear response leading to a strong redistribution of angular momentum in the disk. We find that, depending on the amplitudes of the perturbers, the changes in angular momentum, dL, could occur up to an order of magnitude faster than in the case of recurrent spirals. The signature of this mechanism is a bimodality in dL with maxima near the bar's corotation and its outer Lindblad resonance; this is independent of the properties of the spiral structure. For parameters consistent with the Milky Way the disk mixes in about 3 Gyr and the stellar velocity dispersion increases with time in a manner roughly consistent with observations. This new mechanism could account for both the observed age-velocity relation and the absence of age-metallicity relation in the solar neighborhood. Spiral-bar interaction could also explain observations showing that strongly barred galaxies have weaker metallicity gradients than weakly barred or non-barred galaxies.},

@article{Jones1997,
abstract = {We have analyzed the ROSAT PSPC observations of the central region of the Fornax cluster, a relatively poor group of galaxies at a distance of about 24 Mpc. The brightest X-ray and optical galaxy in the group is NGC 1399, an E1 galaxy located near the center of the Fornax cluster. We characterize the hot gas around the galaxy, derived from a 2' to 18' annulus around NGC 1399, as having a mean temperature of 1.30 +/- 0.05 keV and a heavy element abundance of 0.6 +/- 0.1 with respect to solar abundance (Fe/H = 4.68 × 10-5 by number). Spatially resolved spectral data provide both gas temperature and gas abundance profiles extending to 125 kpc (18') from the galaxy. The temperature distribution, combined with the X-ray surface brightness profile, yields an accurate determination of the gravitating mass within 125 kpc, which falls in the range (4.3-8.1) × 1012 M⊙ (95\% confidence range, including systematic uncertainties). If we include the extended optical halo around NGC 1399, the mass-to-light ratio increases with radius from 33 +/- 8 M⊙/L⊙ at 18 kpc to 70 +/- 22 M⊙/L⊙ at 110 kpc. We compare the heavy element abundance distribution measured around NGC 1399 with that measured around the Virgo galaxy NGC 4472, as well as to models for hot coronae. We find that the abundance distribution is in good agreement with that previously measured for NGC 4472 by Forman et al. in 1993. For both galaxies, the observed abundance profiles require both a weak evolution of the type Ia supernova rate with time and a present epoch rate which agrees with that of Cappellaro et al.  We compare mass measurements in NGC 1399 to those for M87. The similarity of the optical masses in these systems and their differences in gas masses and gravitating masses lead us to suggest that the optical galaxies formed at an early stage when the central potentials of these two systems were similar. Subsequent infall of gas and dark matter into the larger, deeper Virgo potential resulted in the greater mass of the Virgo cluster compared to Fornax.  We also report on X-ray properties of thirteen other Fornax galaxies. Eight of these were detected in ROSAT images with luminosities in the 0.2 to 2 keV energy band from 1 × 1039 to 1.6 × 1041 ergs s-1. Five galaxies were sufficiently bright to permit spectral analyses and all but one (NGC 1380) had spectra consistent with thermal emission. Two (NGC 1404 and NGC 1387) of the four galaxies with well-constrained spectral parameters have hot coronae with characteristic gas temperatures of about 0.5 keV and iron abundances less than that found around NGC 1399 and other bright ellipticals. To maintain these hot coronae, the absolute magnitudes of these galaxies must be brighter than -19. Thus the distance to Fornax must be at least 18 Mpc, and, if there are no large peculiar velocities, the Hubble constant should be less than 75 km s-1 Mpc-1. Since these galaxies are all members of Fornax, distance uncertainties do not affect the relationship between their optical magnitude and X-ray luminosity. Analysis of the Fornax galaxies supports the contention that the scatter in the X-ray and optical relationship is intrinsic and does not arise solely from distance uncertainties. For the elliptical galaxy NGC 1404, the X-ray images show that the hot corona is distorted and likely is being stripped, indicating infall of the galaxy toward NGC 1399 and the cluster center.},

@article{Mihos1994,
abstract = {Using numerical simulation, we explore the triggering of starburst activity in disk galaxies which accrete low-mass dwarf companions. In response to the tidal perturbation of an infalling satellite, a disk galaxy develops a strong two-armed spiral pattern, which in turn drives large quantities of disk gas into its central regions. The global star formation rate stays constant during the early stages of an accretion, before rising rapidly by an order of magnitude when the central gas density becomes very large. The associated central starburst is quite compact. Models which include a bulge component in the disk galaxy show that the presence of a bulge can suppress the radial gas flow and limit the strength of the associated starburst, depending on the overall mass profile. The fact that such relatively common 'minor' mergers may trigger strong starburst activity suggests that many disk galaxies may have experienced starbursts at some point in their lifetime. Implications for galaxy evolution and formation are discussed.},

@article{Roskar2008a,
abstract = {We have performed a high mass and force resolution simulation of an idealized galaxy forming from dissipational collapse of gas embedded in a spherical dark matter halo. The simulation includes star formation and effects of stellar feedback. In our simulation a stellar disk forms with a surface density profile consisting of an inner exponential breaking to a steeper outer exponential. The break forms early on and persists throughout the evolution, moving outward as more gas is able to cool and add mass to the disk. The parameters of the break are in excellent agreement with observations. The break corresponds to a rapid drop in the star formation rate associated with a drop in the cooled gas surface density, but the outer exponential is populated by stars that were scattered outward on nearly circular orbits from the inner disk by spiral arms. The resulting profile and its associated break are therefore a consequence of the interplay between a radial star formation cutoff and redistribution of stellar mass by secular processes. A consequence of such evolution is a sharp change in the radial mean stellar age profile at the break radius.},
